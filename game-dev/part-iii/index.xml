Over the course of 3 workshops, we have something for everyone, whether you’re a beginner or an experienced coder. Inspired by Bloons Tower Defense, you will learn how to code your very own tower-defense game in Processing!

Maybe you accidentally sour a relationship with a close friend, play the wrong chord in a concert after practicing for months, or you drop your lovingly handcrafted bridge for your ISP in a puddle. While we can’t help you with any of those things in this workshop, we can help you when you change your mind on keeping a tower on the board.</description></item><item><title>Tower Upgrades</title><link>https://learning.mcpt.ca/game-dev/part-iii/upgrades/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://learning.mcpt.ca/game-dev/part-iii/upgrades/</guid><description>Upgrades Template UpgradesTemplate.zip (14 KB) Introduction Personally, the part I enjoyed most about Bloons Tower Defence is trying out each path for each tower to see what they all do. Now, in Part III, we’ve finally implemented upgrades. We’ll be teaching you how to edit the different values that you may want to use when making your own upgrade paths.
Framework for Upgrades Before making upgrades, we need to add a state that stores the value of the tower currently clicked.</description></item><item><title>User Interface</title><link>https://learning.mcpt.ca/game-dev/part-iii/userinterface/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://learning.mcpt.ca/game-dev/part-iii/userinterface/</guid><description>Drawing Upgrade &amp;amp; Remove Button In these two methods, we will draw the buttons for upgrading and removing towers. You’ll notice that these two methods are very similar, since they do similar things.
See code for drawing remove button PVector removeLocation = new PVector(255, 470); void drawRemove() { strokeWeight(1); stroke(#deac9e); fill(#FF6961); rectMode(CENTER); rect(removeLocation.x, removeLocation.y, 70, 24,5); textSize(16); fill(#ffffff); text(&amp;#34;Remove&amp;#34;, removeLocation.</description></item><item><title>Making Levels</title><link>https://learning.mcpt.ca/game-dev/part-iii/makinglevels/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://learning.mcpt.ca/game-dev/part-iii/makinglevels/</guid><description>Powerups Template Code APIs.zip (21 KB) Making Levels Now that we are in the 3rd session, some levels in the game are long overdue. Now that we are more familiar with the concept of arrays and arraylists, let’s see how we can implement them
Key Concepts How do we represent a level in code? And how do we store information for it? What happens when a level is being played, and when a level isn&amp;rsquo;t being played?</description></item><item><title>Path Creation API</title><link>https://learning.mcpt.ca/game-dev/part-iii/pathcreationapi/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://learning.mcpt.ca/game-dev/part-iii/pathcreationapi/</guid><description>Powerups Template Code APIs.zip (21 KB) Path Creation API Before this, balloons have moved in straight lines. That’s cool and all, but what if we wanted to implement some maps like this?
Obviously, straight lines are not going to cut it. Instead, we need a way to implement curves, and we need to have some tools that will make it easy for us to smoothly connect them. As a result, we developed an API (a set of useful functions) that will help us do this.</description></item><item><title>Powerups</title><link>https://learning.mcpt.ca/game-dev/part-iii/powerups/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://learning.mcpt.ca/game-dev/part-iii/powerups/</guid><description>Powerups Template Code Powerups_Template.zip (2 KB) Road Spikes One feature in tower defense games is road spikes which are intended for use in urgent situations, where balloons are approaching the end of the path and need to be popped quickly. The implementation of road spikes is similar to towers, but the drag-and-drop interface was slightly different, since spikes are placed on the path rather than off, and they do not shoot anything, but rather sit on the path until a balloon comes by.</description></item><item><title>Challenges</title><link>https://learning.mcpt.ca/game-dev/part-iii/challenge/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://learning.mcpt.ca/game-dev/part-iii/challenge/</guid><description>Challenge Prompt Congratulations on making it to the end of the series!
To celebrate, as well as help you prepare for the Game Jam, we&amp;rsquo;d like to test your game development skills and see how well you can make this game your own!
ChallengeCreate your own spin-off of the game! This is more or less an open-ended question, you are free to do whatever you want.
The first place winner will earn 400 points, with second place earning 350, third place earning 300, etc&amp;hellip; with a minimum of 100 points being awarded for successfully attempting the challenge, on top of the 200 points for participation.</description></item></channel></rss>
