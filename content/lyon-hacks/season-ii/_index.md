### About LyonHacks

---
Welcome to **LyonHacks II**, a 48-hour hackathon!

LyonHacks II will start on **April 15th** at noon and will end on **April 17th** at noon.

A **hackathon** is a programming competition that challenges teams to **design** and **pitch** a **software application** to our panel of judges. During LyonHacks II, teams will create a code-based project that falls under one of the themes, to be released at the start of the competition period. The hackathon will also feature workshops and guest speakers to help build useful skills.

All **Ontario middle and high school students** ages 13-18 are invited to compete, forming **teams** of up to **4 students**. In addition, there will be more than **$250 in prizes** to be won, generously sponsored by the **Educational Computing Organization of Ontario**!

Have any questions or concerns? Feel free to join our Slack at [mcpt.ca/lh-slack](https://mcpt.ca/lh-slack) or email us at __lyonhacks@mcpt.ca__!
