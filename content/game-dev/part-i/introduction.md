## Game Dev - Season IV

Welcome to the return of MCPT's Game Dev Series! Over the course of 3 workshops, we have something for everyone, whether youâ€™re a beginner or an experienced coder. Inspired by **Bloons Tower Defense**, you will learn how to code your very own tower-defense game in Processing!

{{% expand "What is a tower-defense game?" %}}
{{% notice info %}}

A **tower-defense game** is a type of strategy game where players will place down "towers", usually with a form of in-game currency that will defend against a set of enemies. If you fail to defeat the enemies, you will typically lose health - when you reach zero, it's **Game Over.**

In **Bloons Tower Defense**, the towers are monkeys, and the enemies are balloons, which spawn in rounds and travel along a pre-determined path. Your goal as a player is to strategically spend your currency while placing towers in effective locations, using their special abilities to win the game!

In this workshop, we will cover the fundamental aspects of a tower-defense game, and in future workshops, we will cover special abilities and ways that you can customize your game to make it your own!

{{% /notice %}}
{{% /expand %}}

Everything will be made step-by-step allowing you to learn and see the progress of the game. The speed of the workshop is not set and will be altered at a moment's notice in order, so donâ€™t worry if you don't get everything immediately!

This website is interactive and holds all the content that we will be going over. Flip along and test code just as we do! This site will also be accessible at any time for you to look back and review content.

### Additional Info

{{% expand "What you will learn" %}}
{{% notice info %}}
In the first part of this workshop, you will learn about the logic behind the fundamental components in **each level** of a tower-defense game.

This includes: 
* How to use Lists in Processing for Towers and Balloons
* How to create and customize Paths using a list of coordinates
* How to use Mouse Input to create a Drag-And-Drop System
* How to check if Balloons have reached the end of the path
* How to use pre-built template code

You will need to download [Processing 4.0](https://processing.org/download) from https://processing.org/download, or have Processing 3 or newer installed.

In our workshop, we will be adding code to several **templates**, which you can download below.

Ultimately, the Game Dev Series will build up to a week-long Game Jam during the Winter Break. During the Game Jam, you'll develop and create the best game you can!

There will be many prizes and awards so make sure to participate!

In addition, by participating in the Game Dev Series and completing challenges, you will earn points which will help you win awards during the Game Jam.
