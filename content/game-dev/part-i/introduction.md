## Game Dev - Season IV

Welcome to the return of MCPT's Game Dev Series! The Game Dev Series consists of 3 parts where we have something for everyone, whether you’re a beginner or an experienced coder.

Inspired by **Bloons Tower Defense**, you will learn how to code your very own tower-defense game in Processing by the end of a series of workshops.

Everything will be made step by step allowing you to learn and see the progress of the game. The speed of the workshop is not set and will be altered at a moment's notice in order, so don’t worry if you don't get everything immediately!

This website is interactive and holds all the content that we will be going over. Flip along and test code just as we do! This site will also be accessible at any time for you to look back and review content if you would like.

### What is a "Tower Defense Game"?

A tower defense game is a game where you have towers that defend.
