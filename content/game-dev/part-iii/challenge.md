## Challenge Prompt

Congratulations on making it to the end of the series! 

To celebrate, as well as help you prepare for the Game Jam, we'd like to test your game development skills and see how well you can make this game _your own_!

{{% notice info "Challenge" %}}
Create your own spin-off of the game! This is more or less an open-ended question, you are free to do whatever you want.

The first place winner will earn **400** points, with second place earning **375**, third place earning **350**, etc... with a minimum of **100** points being awarded for successfully attempting the challenge, **on top** of the **200** points for participation.

Placements will be determined by a combination of creativity, number of features implemented / changed, as well as _balancing_ of the game; making sure the game is not too easy or too hard.

We suggest any of the following:
* Creating a new path
* Creating a new power-up
* Creating a unique set of upgrades
* Modifying balloon waves / creating new waves for progression

Submit a GitHub / Google Drive link to the form that will be provided during the workshop to earn points!
