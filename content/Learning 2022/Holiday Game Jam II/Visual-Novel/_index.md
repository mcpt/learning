# What's a Visual Novel?

A visual novel is kind of what the name states: A book, visually presented to you on your computer!

However, with the advent of computers, we have completely overhauled how a book is read. Now, you can interact with the characters in real time! Here's a list of some features a visual novel may have:

- A text box at the bottom for dialogue
- Click to progress dialogue
- A “name tag”
- The character’s “portrait”
- Option boxes
- Branching storyline
- You get to play as a character!
