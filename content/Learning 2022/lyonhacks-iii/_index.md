# Lyon Hacks

William Lyon Mackenzie's Annual Hackathon!

### About LyonHacks III

---
Welcome to **LyonHacks III**, a 60-hour hackathon!

LyonHacks III will start on **April 7th** at noon (12:00PM EST) and will end on **April 9th** at 11:59PM EST.

A **hackathon** is a programming competition that challenges teams to **design** and **pitch** a **software application** to our panel of judges. During LyonHacks III, teams will create a code-based project that falls under one of the themes, to be released at the start of the competition period. The hackathon will also feature workshops to help build useful skills.

All **Ontario middle and high school students** ages 13-18 are invited to compete, forming **teams** of up to **4 students**. In addition, there will be many prizes to be won, generously sponsored by **Project Metropolis**!

Have any questions or concerns? Feel free to email us at __lyonhacks@mcpt.ca__!
