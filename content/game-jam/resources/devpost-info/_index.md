Welcome to the Holiday Game Jam! In this document, you will find all the information required in order to prepare for the submission of your hack!

### Step 1: Creating a Devpost Account
---
If you have not already done so, the first thing you need to do is register for a Devpost account. Simply head over to https://devpost.com/ and click the "Sign-up" button on the top right.

You will have the option of signing up with your Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, Email, or Github account. Although this is not required, it is recommended to register via **Github**, as that will provide you with the ability to import Github projects onto your Devpost portfolio for submission. Once you have signed up, you will be prompted with a few basic questions regarding programming that will help you fine-tune your recommendations for future projects and hackathon-like events!

### Step 2: Registering for the Holiday Game Jam
---

Once you have created your Devpost account, make sure to join the Holiday Game Jam by heading over to https://holiday-game-jam.devpost.com/ and clicking on the "Join Hackathon" button.

### Step 3: Create!
---

It’s time to begin brainstorming an idea and coding up your game! This section is almost entirely up to you - just make sure that your idea is school-appropriate. For some tips on how to get started, feel free to check out our [Tips & Tricks Document](/game-jam/resources/tips). 

### Step 4: Setting up your Devpost Submission
---

On https://holiday-game-jam.devpost.com/, you can begin preparing your submission by clicking on the “My Projects” tab and clicking on “Create Project”. **Only one member of the team should create a project.**

Once you have created a project, a general outline of everything you will need to prepare will be displayed. The first and most important thing to do is to add your team members as collaborators in your project in the “Manage team” section of project creation. Here, you will be able to either directly add team members via their email once they have all signed up for Devpost, or send an invite link to them.

Once you have invited your team members, you will all have access to the game and will be able to edit the submission!


A word of caution: **have only one person editing the Devpost project at a time**, or else your work may be overwritten. It is recommended that you collaborate on a Google Doc or something similar, and then designate one member to transfer information to the Devpost.

### Step 5: Creating your Pitch
---

It’s time to prepare to create a presentation for your game! Even if you didn’t get to fully finish up your project, that’s perfectly okay! A big part of the Holiday Game Jam is about creativity, ideas, and learning, so even if you didn't get to create a fully working game in time, it is still strongly recommended to submit your game along with a presentation.


Although there will NOT be any **live judging**, meaning that at no point are you expected to enter a meet and present in real time, there will be a wide variety of resources available to help you create an offline presentation accompanying your submission.


One of the biggest conveniences about Devpost is that it already lays out many of the fundamentals for an offline presentation. If you head over to the “My Projects” tab on https://holiday-game-jam.devpost.com/ and select the project you had created in Step 3, you should see a variety of tabs that you can use to spice up your Devpost submission.

In the **Project Overview** tab, you can come up with a cool and unique name for your submission, as well as a short description / tagline of what the game is about.


In the **Project Details** tab, here is where you can talk *briefly* about all your project features, how it works, how you built it, what it can be used for, and much more! Much of the information you want to put on here is entirely up to you, but Devpost automatically provides a brief outline that you can choose to follow if you think it would fit your project. There will also be many additional features you can choose to add, such as a video demo link, images, and a link to your Github repository.


It is **highly recommended** that you link an offline demo / presentation of some format (preferably a video format), such that judges will be able to either view your project in action via a video, or provide instructions on how to test the project out!

### Step 6: Submitting your Project
---

Congratulations!! You have finished all of the hard work and are now ready to submit your project!

**One** person in your group is required to submit on behalf of the to both **Devpost** and the **Google Form** that will be linked in the resources channel on Discord.
