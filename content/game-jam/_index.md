Introducing MCPT’s first-ever **game jam**!

A game jam is an event where teams create video games and pitch them for the chance to win monetary prizes! It’s a great opportunity to create something cool, and learn a thing or two! We’ll be running many workshops and fun activities throughout the competition.
 
The competition will run from **December 27th** to **December 31st**.

Register in up to **teams of 4** by **December 26th, 11:59 p.m**.
