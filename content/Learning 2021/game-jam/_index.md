##### **What is a game jam?**
---
The **Holiday Game Jam** is both a competitive and social event where teams build and design video games and then **pitch** their ideas to the group. It’s a great opportunity to make new friends, create something cool, and learn a thing or two! Whether you’re proficient with game development or are trying it out for the first time, we have something for everyone.

New to game dev? No worries! We’ll be running many different **workshops** over the course of the **Holiday Game Jam**, topics include how to create Tetris controls or program jump physics! If you ever feel tired or want to take a quick break from the competition we’ll also be hosting many fun activities and games for you to participate in! And for those who participated in MCPT’s Game Dev series, your points will carry over into this event.

Didn’t get the chance to check out our game dev series? Visit [our site](/game-dev) to check out our lessons.

##### **Dates and Times**
---
The competition will run from **December 27th** at noon to **December 31st** at noon. Teams will have the full 96 hours to design a game and pitch. Note that you may only start working on your project once the competition window begins on December 27th at noon.
