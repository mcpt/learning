## Game Dev - Season IV

Welcome to the return of MCPT's Game Dev Series! Over the course of 3 workshops, we have something for everyone, whether you’re a beginner or an experienced coder. Inspired by **Bloons Tower Defense**, you will learn how to code your very own tower-defense game in Processing!
### Demo

{{% notice info %}}

A **tower-defense game** is a type of strategy game where players will place down "towers", usually with a form of in-game currency that will defend against a set of enemies. If you fail to defeat the enemies, you will typically lose health - when you reach zero, it's **Game Over.**

In **Bloons Tower Defense**, the towers are monkeys, and the enemies are balloons, which spawn in rounds and travel along a pre-determined path. Your goal as a player is to strategically spend your currency while placing towers in effective locations, using their special abilities to win the game!

In this workshop, we will cover the fundamental aspects of a tower-defense game, and in future workshops, we will cover special abilities and ways that you can customize your game to make it your own!

Everything will be made step-by-step allowing you to learn and see the progress of the game. The speed of the workshop is not set and will be altered at a moment's notice in order, so don’t worry if you don't get everything immediately!

This website is interactive and holds all the content that we will be going over. Flip along and test code just as we do! This site will also be accessible at any time for you to look back and review content.
